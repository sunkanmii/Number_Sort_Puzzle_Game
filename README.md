# Number_Sort_Puzzle_Game
Hey there!:blush:

I made this game using just HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. Feel free to read the Controls section to learn how to play :).

## Controls
Once you have clicked on "New game" and selected the number of rows by column you want to solve. Do follow these directions below :point_down:
* Tap the :arrow_backward: left arrow on your keyboard to move the orange box left and push the number at its former position right.
* Tap the :arrow_forward: right arrow on your keyboard to move the orange box right and push the number at its former position left. 
* Tap the :arrow_up_small: up arrow on your keyboard to move the orange box up and push the number at its former position down.
* Tap the :arrow_down_small: down arrow on your keyboard to move the orange box down and push the number at its former position up.
Keep solving till you achieve a perfect sequence **with the limited time you have** (yeah, things won't be interesting without a time attack :trollface:).

For example, let's say I choose the 4 by 4 rows & columns.

Next I click on the "Okay!" button
It will take you to the next page and this happens when I press the up arrow button on my keyboard.
